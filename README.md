# Own-Your-Terms
"Own your terms" relies on the Chat-GPT's OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model. This browser extension is designed to automatically analyze the terms and conditions accepted by a user, identifying any concerning aspects within them. Additionally, it conveniently stores this information for later use.

The preserved Terms & Conditions are retrievable at a later time through a chat interface. Users have the ability to ask questions about the content within the agreement they've endorsed by querying the document. Additionally, there's a choice to upload these documents to the website.
